			<legend><h3>LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS – COOKING GAS SAFETY TIPS</h3></legend>
				<p>When purchasing an LPG cylinder, ensure you are getting an original cylinder from an authorized dealer. Do not accept the Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinder if the seal is broken. Request the attendant to use the 5-point safety steps which include:

Regulator: This is normally pre-set according to the required operating pressure. Ensure it’s not worn out, and that it’s replaced every five years.
Hose: Check the rubber hose to make sure it’s not punctured as this may lead to a gas leak. It needs to be replaced every two years.
Hose clips: The clips need to be in good working condition and that they are properly secured.
Cylinder: Inspect the cylinder for cracks.
Leak Test: Use a soap solution to be sure there are no gas leaks. Apply the solution on the cylinder joints and the presence of bubbles is an indication that there is a leak.
Note: Do not use an open flame to test for gas leaks.
				</p>

				<h4>When Cooking using Liquefied Petroleum Gas…</h4>
					<p>Open windows for proper ventilation.
Don’t place flammable items near the cylinder.
Ensure pan handles don’t come into direct contact with the open flame.
Never leave an open flame unattended as liquids can boil and over flow therefore, extinguishing the fire. This will cause the gas to leak posing a huge fire risk.</p>

				<h4>Tips to help you cook safely with Total Gas:</h4>
					<p>Position your cooker away from Combustible surfaces
Gas spreads fast and unknowingly unless you are keen to smell it. To be safe, keep your gas cooker away from exhaust fans. Take note that fans can easily facilitate spreading of gas posing a danger not just to the kitchen but entire household. To be safe, position exhaust fans 750mm above, burners should stay out of sight at least 200mm.

<h5>Do not overheat cooking fats and oils</h5>
Domestic fires caused by gas are on the rise. Unfortunately what we do is not dig deep into the reason that caused the fire.  Fats and cooking oils are capable of withstanding heat for a specific period of time. Once their heating levels are passed, such fats will ignite causing fire.  However, this only happens if you leave your cooking unattended.

<h5>When cooking ensure the gas does not go out</h5>
Gas is invisible and when cooking it is hardly possible to notice its smell. This creates the best opportunity for it to escape and leak without your knowledge. Gas spreads due to excess wind when windows are opened. To avoid any accidents when cooking with gas, set your window to bring in enough fresh air and not one that could seemingly pose danger.

<h5>Clean Cook Tops Regularly</h5>
With so much going on the only thing we focus on is getting that food ready on time. We do not pay attention to the dirt and fat that has built up on the cooking tops. Maybe you do not know the damage it can cause. When lighting the gas every day, fat is exposed to heat and when the temperatures are surpassed it will ignite causing fire. Maintaining cleanliness will help prevent such accidents in the kitchen.

<h5>Install/Connect gas system correctly</h5>
Unless you have been taken through the process of connecting gas system it is not easy to do so.  Gas leaks eventually begin and it’s always late when you come to realize. Gas leaks cause massive damages and could burn your entire household. The mistake we do is assumed that everything is locked tightly and there start using our appliances. You must have someone teach and demonstrate to you. If not a gas vendor, you could ask a plumber/technician to assist in fixing your gas.</p>
